## Overview

Create an Javascript quiz wherby the user is presented with a set of questions and multiple choice answers. The user has 60 seconds (based around 12 seconds per question). If the user selects the correct answer the timer keeps on ticking down 1 second at a time. A wrong answer given will deduct 10 seconds immediatley from timer.

The user should be given a message on screen showing whether question answered correctly or not. The quiz ends when either all 5 questions have been answered or the timer runs out.

The end score is based on how many seconds remain after the final question.

The player can enter initials to store their score and compare their previous scores against each other by clicking a High Score button.

This app will run in the browser, and will feature Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Use of Javascript variables, functions, For loops as well as maths and if conditions

### What I learned

Using Javascript the HTML page can become fully interactive with the users choices defining various outcomes. Timers can be introduced to the screen and manipulated via user interaction to tic down faster (minus seconds on wrong answer).

Storing information in local storage allows us to hold on to generated information and display it later. In this instance by storing and reproducing score data on screen.
